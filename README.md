Lost'n Phoned
=============

You will never lose your phone again!

Three ways to find your phone:
 - A call from a specific number will deactivate the silent mode and put the volume at its maximum
 - A code sent from a friend by SMS will trigger a loud alarm with the flash blinking
 - Another code by SMS will send back the location of your phone
